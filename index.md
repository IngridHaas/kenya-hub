# Land, Soil and Crop Information Hub

This hub facilitates effective access to Land Soil and Crop information data, making existing resources better findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).

The LSC hub supports improved decision-making for climate-smart agriculture at national, regional and local levels. The focus is on two use cases: soil fertility management and soil water conservation.

## Data

The LSC hub offers a diverse range of datasets, maps and documents, including observational data from field studies (e.g., soil and water samples, crop yields), aerial and space observations, administrative boundaries, economic data (price development), predictive model outputs (soil, weather, yields), and population statistics.

## Information services

Information services provide dedicated information derived from relevant data to a targeted audience.

Processing raw data in many cases requires expert knowledge. To bring the value of the data to a wider audience, it is of interest to set up information services derived from that data to targeted audiences.

## Predictive modeling

Predictive modeling in the LSC hub focuses on Soil Fertility and Soil Water Conservation and is a data-driven analytical approach that involves the use of statistical or machine learning techniques to create models that can make predictions about future events or outcomes based on historical data.

### Soil Fertility Management

Current fertilizer and soil recommendations lack local context, leading to soil health decline and lower productivity. Integrated Soil Fertility Management can improve practices, boost yields, and provide climate benefits. This case aims to deliver better agronomic advice to farmers via agricultural extension services or directly, using existing data and tools.

### Soil Water Conservation

Soil erosion threatens sustainability, climate, and food security in hilly regions of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Rwanda. Current land practices neglect local factors and erosion risks. The goal is to inform stakeholders and promote sustainable land practices for LDN, providing catchment managers and farmers with relevant information through the LSC-hub.
