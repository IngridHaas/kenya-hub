# Aspects of Accessibility

## Persistence

- Move the resource to a shared environment (backup)
- Consider a URL strategy
- Use a facade identifier (DOI) 

## Data lifecycle

- Consider upfront when to remove a resource (10 yrs?)
- What happens to the URI of a resource which is archived?
- Metadata should stay available, even if the data are no longer

# Tools

## Repository software

- Webdav (or webserver software)
- Zenodo, Dataverse
- Document Management Systems (DMS)
- Cloud storage (google drive, dropbox, Amazon, Sharepoint)

## testing tools

- Automated link checking
- Usage logs filter on status 404 & referer
- Google Search Console notifies broken links
