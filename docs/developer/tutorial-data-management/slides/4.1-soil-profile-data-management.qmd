## History

Various efforts have been made to harmonise Soil Profile data

- GlobalSoilMap
- eSOTER
- ISO28258
- GLOSIS Web ontology


## e-SOTER

- Relational database model, usually in Microsoft Access

- [Kenya](https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/73e27136-9efe-49e4-af35-fd98b841d467)
- [Southern Africa](https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/3571c1f3-159d-442c-b324-0af53d03f12e)
- [Senegal and Gambia](https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/a6320590-0899-4b60-bf4d-f80282bbb72c)

## ISO28258

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- ISO28258 is based on Observations and measurements
- every field observation and laboratory analysis as a sensor observation

## ISO28258 in GML

- Serialisation of ISO28258 in GML (app schema)
- Quite complex implementation and low support in tooling

- [INSPIRE Soil](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/Themes/127/2892) (Europe)  
- [ANZSoilML](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/ANZSoilML) (Australia) 

- Alternative is a serialisation in JSON using Sensorthings API.

## ISO28258 as relational database

- A relational model is available according to ISO28258
- Either as PostGreSQL or GeoPackage (SQLite)
- Read more at <https://iso28258.isric.org>

## GLOSIS Web Ontology

- ISO28258 expressed using common web ontologys (SOSA, VCARD)
- Includes codelists for soil properties and procedures

## Harmonisation of field, lab and archived data

- Use common codelists to identify properties, methods, units
- Hale Studio and FME are tools for data harmonisation
- Also SQL scripts are often used to harmonise data
- Semantic web community offers harmonisation tools (rml.io, tarql, csv-ld)
